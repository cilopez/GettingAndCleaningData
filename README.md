## Repository for JHU coursera project

Four important things to notice about this project
- Everything has been made on the run_analysis script, there's no other code attached.
- The data is included in the repo, howeer in the code every file is downloaded again.
- If files are downloaded, then the zip file will be created on the folder.
- If there's a need to recreate the dataframe, _run_analysis.R_ will create tidy.txt.
